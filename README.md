# INSIGHTS & RECOMMENDATIONS

- ### As cancellation rates are higher for City Hotel, we need to make some extra effort to improve its performance.

## 2-	The cancellation rate increases as the gap between booking and arrival increases.
-	### We should set a limit on the lead time, like you can’t book a room before a month of arrival.
-	### We can set the limit to 2 weeks max.
## 3-	Cancellation rates are lower in November.
-	### We need to communicate with the management team to understand why cancellation rates are lower in November.

## 4-	Bookings are higher in July – August – October.

## 5-	Bookings are high at the end of the month.
